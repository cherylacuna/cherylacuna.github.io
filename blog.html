                    Jonas' mortuary (1)
                </blockquote>
Morning light filtered through the rafters of St. Jakob’s: thin, stretched, and dry. Thomas was parched. He could feel it in the fur of his tail, which had grown particularly lackluster as of late—a quality that did nothing for the young squirrel’s ego.<br>
"Bits o' bread for Auntie, a morsel o' cheese for Uncle," Thomas sang in a solemn whisper, his voice no more than a squeak. "Mayhaps even a sweet sausage for me, or a thimble of wine… if the Lord is feeling generous…”<br>
He darted along, his tiny paws pattering softly on the wood, a rogue in a house of relics. Thomas knew every nook and beam of the old Christuskirche, every cobwebbed corner and creaky cranny. After all, he was the best scavenger in his ragtag family—a claim he bore boldly—and, in his opinion, the best in all of Oberpfalz.<br>
But as Thomas moved through his rituals, he caught the sound of murmuring voices rising from the study below. He paused, listening, ears perked. A council was gathered—acolyte and elder. A disagreement was to be had. They spoke not of small matters but of things eternal and unseen, concepts Thomas couldn’t grasp but always felt the urge to heed.<br>
“To have faith is to walk in darkness,” one muttered, weary and impatient. His voice was low, his arms stretched out in front of him, his palms turned up in silent supplication. These words had been heard and spoken many times before. “But what are we, Bruder Gerhard, if all is decided? What value is there in the faith of one who is chosen by fate alone?” A palm met the face of the table with a slap.<br>
Thomas crouched low, watching as the elder, tall and somber, lifted his head, eyes fixed on something distant, something Thomas could not see. Crimson rays from the stained glass fell across the acolyte’s hand, bleeding red onto the wood. The elder’s voice, deep, laden with age and doubt, echoed an answer.<br>
“Love seeks no cause beyond itself and no fruit; it is its own fruit, its own enjoyment. I love because I love; I love that I may love.” The words lingered for a moment, heavy as dust. “I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but I believe in order to understand,” he said, and Thomas scurried on.<br>
In the kitchen, he found his loot: a slab of soft cheese and a slice of sour bread. The Lord had indeed blessed the day with an abandoned Eucharist from the night before, so Thomas allowed himself a gulp.<br>
He filled his satchel with what would fit, fastened it again upon his back, and set out to return from whence he came.<br>
The kitchen, studies, prayer rooms, and dormitories were all situated on the west side of the priory, but his family’s nest lay near the heart of the church: above the nave, tucked behind the organ alcove, perched on the ledge of the smallest clerestory window. That was his home.<br>
He scurried across the flagstone kitchen floor and under the stone archway toward the cloister. He jumped along the plinths of each pillar as he made his route along the sheltered pathway. His Auntie Clara always warned him to run along the underside of the hedge, away from view, but it was early, and Thomas loved to feel the morning sun on his wiry fur.<br>

The theater of fear plays out in cycles: performance, projection, ambiguity, avoidance, impediment, impossibility, irony, indifferece, obscurity: death and her chariot lead languid and parroting, death and her chariot come horses three. <br><br>
When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.  For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three remain; but the greatest of these is love.            </div><br><br>

Terry Davis. Terry Richardson. Terrycloth Balenciaga. There are fleas in my apartment. I've had fleas since before I moved here, actually, they just didn't bother me back then because they hadn't yet whittled their way into my mattress. Spiral-staircase-to-a-loft has always been my dream. I'm living my dream. Even with the fleas, I'm living my dream. Even if he never texts me again, I'm living my dream.
<br><br>
If indie-sleaze is back I don't want to be a part of it. If Calvinism is Gnostic-Nihlism, am I a heretic because I develop telepathy whenever I do at least one full line of ketamine? Theocracy is dead but God isn't. If falling in love and killing yourself are the same thing, I'm several times dead and buried. If God loves me no matter what, who cares if I lose 20 pounds from only eating carrots with wasabi and raw beef with raw egg? (Farmer's market eggs, the kind that you can leave on the counter for two weeks and they won't spoil.)
<br><br>
Milk, too. Always milk.
<br><br>
But I'll only drink whole milk even though the calories are more than I like to ascribe to a single source and I'll only eat sushi (over sashimi) if it's bought for me by a man who loves me more than I love him. Or maybe it's the other way around? Maybe I love him more than he loves me. Because I love in a way he doesn't understand, or won't understand. Because I love everyone the way God loves me: no matter what. 
<br><br>So anyway there are fleas in my dream, but God loves me no matter what.</p>
