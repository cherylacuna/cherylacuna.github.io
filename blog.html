Terry Davis. Terry Richardson. Terrycloth Balenciaga. There are fleas in my apartment. I've had fleas since before I moved here, actually, they just didn't bother me back in Chicago because they never whittled their way into my mattress. Spiral-staircase-to-a-loft has always been my dream. I'm living my dream. Even with the fleas, I'm living my dream. Even if he never texts me again, I'm living my dream.
<br><br>
If indie-sleaze is back I don't want to be a part of it. If Calvinism is Gnostic-Nihlism, am I a heretic because I develop telepathy whenever I do at least one full line of ketamine? Theocracy is dead but God isn't. If falling in love and killing yourself are the same thing, I'm several times dead and buried. If God loves me no matter what, who cares if I lose 20 pounds from only eating carrots with wasabi and raw beef with raw egg? (Farmer's market eggs, the kind that you can leave on the counter for two weeks and they won't spoil.)
<br><br>
Milk, too. Always milk.
<br><br>
But I'll only drink whole milk even though the calories are more than I like to ascribe to a single source and I'll only eat sushi (over sashimi) if it's bought for me by a man who loves me more than I love him. Or maybe it's the other way around? Maybe I love him more than he loves me. Because I love in a way he doesn't understand, or won't understand. Because I love everyone the way God loves me: no matter what. 
<br><br>So anyway there are fleas in my dream, but God loves me no matter what.</p>
