        A: `<p>A is for Archive, a group of things alike. <br>
        Compiled by some person, some group or organization: an archive shows us what we had in the past when life was different.</p>
        <p>Put together like a puzzle, we prioritize the source. <br>
        With manuscripts and letters, with files and reports—an archive brings together whatever we decide to sort.</p>
        `,
        B: `<p>B is for Jeremy Belknap, the reverend.<br>
From him, American historical society descends.<br>
Today, we may think his work chintzy,<br>
Amatures preserving Massaschuettes—letters from J. Adams to son Quincy.<br>
Yet the truth within these documents, the knowledge they aphend, surely such a feat is worthy of commend.<br>
</p>
        `,
        C: `<p>C is for Community, the places where we tend to be.<br>
        When we come together, we start a synchronicity. <br>
        We create an archive from the people around us, the stories that we see.<br> 
        We talk about all the people that came before us, we gather memories, artifacts and their oral history.
</p>
        `,
        D: ` <p> D stands for Dutch Manual written in 1898.<br>
To kick off archival theory was this little book’s fate.<br>
Key concepts like provenance explored by Muller, Feith, and Fruin.<br>
If you want to learn archival history, to this volume you can tune in.<br>
Original order is a tool to use if you want to keep things straight.<br>

<p>
`,
  E: ` <p> E is for Evidence, something used to prove the truth.<br>
The more information, the more fuel for the sleuth.<br>
If someone goes around looking out for facts<br>
They might visit an archive and look through the stacks.<br>
Here they will find materials stored and tightly packed<br>
And here can come to conclusions through stories kept intact.<p>
`,
  F: ` <p>F is for the Freedom of Information Act in America.<br>
The right to access records ensures accountability. <br>
We open the doors of archives wide, to see how decisions were made inside.<br>
Freedom ensures that power can be checked,<br>
That the public sees what's left or wrecked.<br>
From emails to memos, from laws to the press,<br>
An archive empowers freedom and transparency's success.</p>
  `,
  G: `<p>G is for A.J. Gilliand, Jervois is her née<br>
Among the greatest archival scholars of our day<br>
In youth, she studied Old Norse,<br>
But now, at UCLA, you can take her course<br>
And learn about Micronesia and from an archival sensai.<br>
</p>
  `,
  H: ` <p>H is for Hollinger box, a special cardboard box to hold documents and photographs.<br>
You will see many of these on the shelves at an archive<br>
They are designed to keep physical materials safe and alive.<br>
In one of these, paper will last years and years<br>
And the archivist can sleep at night, without fear.<br>
</p>
  `,
  I: `<p>I is for Integration, where knowledge comes together.<br>
Through archives, we link threads of the past,<br>
Blending stories to ensure they last.<br>
Integration helps us respect elder voices long suppressed,<br>
Indigenous archives hold deep truths unexpressed.<br>
From oral histories to songs and art passed down,<br>
Integration ensures no culture is left without renown.<br>
The maps and records intertwine,<br>
We honor each story as equally divine.<br>
</p>
  `,
J: `<p>J is for Jenkinson, as in Hilary.<br>
An early node in archival theory’s family tree.<br>
He battled with Schellenberg on appraisal and selection<br>
And believed archives came together by a natural process, not collection.<br>
Western archivists, to some extent, are all his advisee<br>
They follow what he started and expand upon his lead.
</p>
  `,
  K: `<p>K is for Korea, the first site of moveable type.<br>
It’s in the Korean king’s court where we find an archival prototype.<br>
All day, the king’s actions were recorded<br>
By the court historian, they stayed hoarded<br>
Until the next king poison dart’d the regent via blowpipe.<br>

  `,
L: ` 
  `,
  M: `
  `,
N: `<p>N is for the National Archives, where we keep US Government history.<br>
People who work here have a fancy college degree.<br>
Their job is to save things for future generations, like yours, to see.<br>
The Declaration of Independence is a piece of paper that made our country free
It can be found here, on the mall, in Washington DC.<br>
</p>
  `,
    O: `<p>O is for Outreach, that’s a thing archives must do.<br>
Think of outreach like connection, think of it like glue!<br>
Archives build relationships with patrons and users<br>
Through the way they represent themselves like webpages on computers.<br>
Outreach is also how materials are solicited<br>
This is why we must be careful, many feelings to be elicited.<br>
An archive’s good outreach could tie a community together<br>
But if done poorly, you leave them vulnerable in stormy weather.<br>
From the Library of Congress to the archive for a tiny community<br>
In outreach, everyone must engage, it’s an important opportunity.<br>
