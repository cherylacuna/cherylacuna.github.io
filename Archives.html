    const boxContent = {
        A: `<p>A is for Archive, a group of things alike <br>
        Compiled by some person, some group or organization, <br>
        An archive shows us what we had in the past when life was different</p>
        <p>Put together like a puzzle, we prioritize the source<br>
        With manuscripts and letters, with files and reports<br>
        An archive brings together whatever we decide to sort</p>
        `,
        B: `<p>B is for Jeremy Belknap, the reverend<br>
From him, American historical society descends<br>
Today, we may think his work chintzy,<br>
Amatures preserving Massaschuettes—letters from J. Adams to son Quincy<br>
Yet the fact these documents survive is surely worthy of commend<br>
</p>
        `,
        C: `<p>C is for Community, the places where we tend to be<br>
        When we come together, we start a synchronicity <br>
        We create an archive from the people around us, the stories that we see<br> 
        We talk about all the people that came before us, we gather memories, artifacts and their oral history
</p>
        `,
        D: ` <p> D stands for Dutch Manual written in 1898<br>
To kick off archival theory was this little book’s fate<br>
Key concepts like provenance explored by Muller, Feith, and Fruin<br>
If you want to learn archival history, to this volume you can tune in<br>
Original order is a tool to use if you want to keep things straight<br>

<p>
`,
  E: ` <p> E is for Evidence, something used to prove the truth<br>
The more information, the more fuel for the sleuth<br>
If someone goes around looking out for facts<br>
They might visit an archive and look through the stacks<br>
Here they will find materials stored and tightly packed<br>
And here can come to conclusions through stories kept intact<p>
`,
  F: ` <p>F is for the Freedom of Information Act in America<br>
The right to access records ensures accountability<br>
We open the doors of archives wide, to see how decisions were made inside<br>
Freedom ensures that power can be checked,<br>
That the public sees what's left or wrecked<br>
From emails to memos, from laws to the press,<br>
An archive empowers freedom and transparency's success</p>
  `,
  G: `<p>G is for genealogy, the study of family<br>
If you want to learn where you come from, archives won’t leave you clammy<br>
Archives host the records which help you trace your Grandparent’s immigration<br>
Because all life leaves records of its movements, from people to crustaceans<br>
Records and archives can teach you more about where you comes from<br>
You can arrange your family’s documents like a trail of breadcrumbs
</p>
  `,
  H: ` <p>H is for Hollinger box, a special cardboard box to hold documents and photographs<br>
You will see many of these on the shelves at an archive<br>
They are designed to keep physical materials safe and alive<br>
In one of these, paper will last years and years<br>
And the archivist can sleep at night, without fear<br>
</p>
  `,
  I: `<p>I is for Integration, where knowledge comes together<br>
Through archives, we link threads of the past,<br>
Blending stories to ensure they last<br>
Integration helps us respect elder voices long suppressed,<br>
Indigenous archives hold deep truths unexpressed<br>
From oral histories to songs and art passed down,<br>
Integration ensures no culture is left without renown<br>
The maps and records intertwine,<br>
We honor each story as equally divine<br>
</p>
  `,
J: `<p>J is for Jenkinson, as in Hilary<br>
An early node in archival theory’s family tree<br>
He battled with Schellenberg on appraisal and selection<br>
And believed archives came together by a natural process, not collection<br>
Western archivists, to some extent, are all his advisee<br>
They follow what he started and expand upon his lead
</p>
  `,
  K: `<p>K is for Korea, the first site of moveable type<br>
It’s in the Korean king’s court where we find an archival prototype<br>
All day, the king’s actions were recorded<br>
By the court historian, they stayed hoarded<br>
Until the next king poison dart’d the regent via blowpipe<br>

  `,
L: `<p>L is for Living archives, think hadiths or Talmud<br>
A collection of non-tangible records, where no pen has been used<br>
We find these in cultures of orality!<br>
Living people verbally speaking the archive in totality<br>
And from there, into the people, information is imbued</p>

  `,
  M: `<p>M is for Memory—a thing we can’t really see<br>
Yet it lives in all of us, and the archive to some degree<br>
Memory work is important at sites of conflict like Irelands or Yugoslavs<br>
And for that reason, we politicize it like brain-Bolshiveks and mind-Romanovs<br>
National memory is performed through parades and flags<br>
Or selectively imposed by the media through films and ads<br>
Memory is such stuff as archives are made on<br>
It influences collective behavior, like naming your kid John<br>
Constantly at risk, sometimes we all want to blot<br>
But memory is a thread that connects us all in its knot</p>
  `,
N: `<p>N is for the National Archives, where we keep US Government history<br>
People who work here have a fancy college degree<br>
Their job is to save things for future generations, like yours, to see<br>
The Declaration of Independence is a piece of paper that made our country free
It can be found here, on the mall, in Washington DC<br>
</p>
  `,
    O: `<p>O is for Outreach, that’s a thing archives must do<br>
Think of outreach like connection, think of it like glue!<br>
Archives build relationships with patrons and users<br>
Through the way they represent themselves like webpages on computers.<br>
Outreach is also how materials are solicited<br>
This is why we must be careful, many feelings to be elicited<br>
An archive’s good outreach could tie a community together<br>
But if done poorly, you leave them vulnerable in stormy weather<br>
From the Library of Congress to the archive for a tiny community<br>
In outreach, everyone must engage, it’s an important opportunity<br>
</p>
  `, 
    P: `<p>P is for Preservation, or the act of saving something across time<br>
It's not uncommon for things to fall apart after their prime<br>
But there are steps we can take to prevent this in the meantime<br>
For example, to preserve a book, pick it up by the middle of its spine<br>
And store it upright to ease pressure on the bind
    </p>
  `,
 Q: `<p>Q is for Query, which is sort of like a question<br>
Archives begin with an inquisitive mind,<br>
Searching for truths that we all hope to find<br>
Through keywords and clues and the paths they take,
Our queries shape the discoveries and the paths we make<br>
Each question pulls a thread to weave,<br>
A tapestry of answers we believe</p>
  `,
R: `<p>R is for Repatriation, to return something<br>
Ownership becomes complicated in times of conquest and war<br>
Sometimes objects are taken away from those made them, from who they belonged to before<br>
Repatriation is a peacemakers act<br>
It is respectful to give things back <br></p>

  `,
S: `<p>S is for Smith, Harry Everett,<br>
American magus of the irrelevant <br>
His work covers almost all fonds,<br>
to his word he was bond:<br>
“I’ll collect it be whatever it.”</p>

  `,
 T: `<p>T is for Tangible, something we can touch<br>
In an archive, there are likely many objects as such<br>
But there are also things we want to remember that we can’t touch<br>
Music, traditions, beliefs, skills, ideas, and memories are just a few<br>
We can pass them along person to person, from me to you</p>

  `,
U: `<p>U is for Users, that’s you and me!<br>
Just monkeys climbing up the information tree<br>
This info is butter and our use clarifies it to ghee<br>
So make a request, it’s usually free!</p>

  `,
V: `<p>V is for value, what something is worth<br>
Monetary is one, but there are more to unearth<br>
An object can have sentimental value if it makes you shed a tear<br>
Or historical value if it helps determine what happened in which year</p>

  `,
W: `<p>W is for Web archive, you can visit on the computer without leaving home<br>
Information at your fingertips through which you can comb<br>
The internet can unite collections across time and spaces<br>
Even though the records may physically live in different places 
</p>
  `,
X: `<p>X is for REDACTED, things we can't see<br>
When an institution wants to keep information secret from you and me<br>
Sometimes they cover up names, dates, and places<br>
Leaving behind black or white boxes as silent traces
</p>
  `,
Y: `<p>Y is for Yearn, the desire to uncover<br>
In archives, we find the whispers of others<br>
We yearn for knowledge to fill in the gaps,<br>
The stories erased or lost in maps
</p>
  `,
Z: `<p>Z is for Zeitgeist, the spirit of the age<br>
An archive captures history's page<br>
The letters, the art, the records of life,<br>
Hold the essence of joy, of struggle, and strife<br>
The zeitgeist survives in what’s stored and preserved,<br>
Reflection for the future of the time that it has served
</p>
